## OOP Principals

 - Encapsulation is when methods and properties are treated as one class
 - Inheritance is the ability to receive methods and properties from an other classes.
 - Polymorphism is when different classes implement the same methods and properties in different ways.
 - Abstraction is when you make different classes not in the front line so they can be utilized more securely and efficiently.

 - I am using encapsulation in oder to make it so we only have to make a pickup and not have to make a truck or vehicle.
 - I am using inheritance so I Don't need to set a speed on each vehicle and I just need to set it once and inherit it down.
 - I am using polymorphism so I can overwrite things when they are either undefined or utilized in deferent ways than current ways.
 - I am using abstraction so when I have a specific car and I don't need to build out all of the properties of a vehicle.

### Interfaces

 - An interface is something that allows you to make properties that are mandatory and allows cohesiveness around your classes.

 - I am using an interface to make sure my cars have speed and fuel consumption.
